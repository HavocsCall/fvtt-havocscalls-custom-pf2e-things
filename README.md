# HavocsCall's Custom PF2E Things

This is just a module for my small additions to FoundryVTT's Pathfinder 2nd Edition System. Most of these are small additions using the "vanilla" FoundryVTT and PF2E System. As of now, there are no scripts.

This adds compendiums with Actors, Items, Journals, Macros, and Scenes.

## FAQ
#### Will you add X, Y, and Z?

Right now, I am only adding things that I have run into through my campaigns. If you would like something specific, ask. I might be able to help.
